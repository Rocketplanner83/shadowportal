ShadowPortal architecture enforcement rules:

1. `BaseZFSService` must remain an abstract base class.
2. All backend services must inherit from `BaseZFSService`.
3. `app.py` must never directly import backend implementations.
4. Any new method added to `BaseZFSService` must be implemented by both backends.
5. Backend detection/selection logic must remain centralized in `services/service_factory.py`.
